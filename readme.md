# Overview
This is a repository of all the Python projects that I attempt. (Python3)  I am using a few different resources to re-learn the language.  My favorite resources are the books from No Starch Press.  They have Python books for many different topics and learning styles.  There are also many different books for different levels of programmers.

## Additional Ramblings about the repository
I just decided to add everything to this repository.  It will look like I update Github more regularly.  I am practicing using python and there are a ton of different project ideas that I have.  This is the best way for me to keep track of them.
